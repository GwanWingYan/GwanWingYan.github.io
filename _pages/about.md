I am a MPhil candidate in Computer Science Department at The University of Hong Kong. 
I am under the supervision of [Prof. Heming Cui](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~heming/).

My research interests are in blockchain and security.
During my MPhil research, I have dedicated my focus to enhancing blockchain data confidentiality via using cryptography primitives, such as fully homomorphic encryption.
Additionally, I have been focusing on accelerating the execution of cryptography primitives on blockchains via designing novel blockchain workflows, including leveraging GPU parallel execution.
